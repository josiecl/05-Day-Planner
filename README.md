# 05-Day-Planner
Day planner assignment

# Why it was Made
This website was made in order to help people who require an online planner for their workday. From the hours of 9 to 5, this planner gives the user the ability to set tasks for certain hours and save them to their local storage, so they can easily check what tasks are left. It also tells the user when it is time for that task through the use of moment.js and class changes of the hours. It also lets the user know when the time is past for a certain task. It is overall very useful for organizational purposes and very helpful for work.

# Information
This site already had some code built into it, including certain classes and built-in HTML. It mostly required work on the Javascript end, and setting classes to sections for the layout to appear properly. Through this assignment, I was able to add moment.js to display the current time and date. I was also able to target ids in order to change the class of the id depending on the time of day. I was also able to save entered information to local storage upon the press of a button. I learned a lot from this assignment, and feel much more comfortable with Javascript thanks to it.
