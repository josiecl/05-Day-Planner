# Why it was Made
This website was made in order to help people who require an online planner for their workday. From the hours of 9 to 5, this planner gives the user the ability to set tasks for certain hours and save them to their local storage, so they can easily check what tasks are left. It also tells the user when it is time for that task through the use of moment.js and class changes of the hours. It also lets the user know when the time is past for a certain task. It is overall very useful for organizational purposes and very helpful for work.
